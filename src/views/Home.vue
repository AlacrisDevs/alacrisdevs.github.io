      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>I'm <b>Alacris Devs</b> (or Alex), a versatile creator from Estonia, specializing in graphic design, event
        management, and game development.<br /><br />

        With a background in graphic design since <b>2019</b>, I’ve collaborated with over 30 clients, helping them
        shape distinctive brand identities. Alongside design, I’m deeply involved in game development, including my work
        on <b>Packet Mayhem</b>, a multiplayer game I built during my studies.<br /><br />

        Currently, I’m the main organizer of <b>TalTech GameCamp</b> and <b>Gamedev Guild</b>, where I bring together
        developers and enthusiasts to share knowledge, network, and create! These events, hosted in collaboration with
        Estonian game developers and <b>TalTech Tallinn University of Technology</b>, have grown into key platforms for
        Estonia’s game development community.
