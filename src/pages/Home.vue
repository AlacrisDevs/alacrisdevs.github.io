      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>I'm Alacris Devs (or Alex) and I am a versatile creator from Estonia, specializing in graphic design, event
        management, and game development.<br /><br />With a background in graphic design since 2019, I’ve collaborated
        with over 30 clients, helping them shape distinctive brand identities.<br />Alongside design, I’m deeply
        involved in game development, including my work on Packet Mayhem, a multiplayer game I built during my
        studies.<br /><br />Currently, I’m the main organizer of TalTech GameCamp and Gamedev Guild, where I bring
        together developers and enthusiasts to share knowledge, network, and create!<br />These events, hosted
        in collaboration with Estonian game developers and TalTech - Tallinn University of Technology, have grown into
        key platforms for Estonia’s game development community.
