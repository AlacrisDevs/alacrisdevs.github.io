# Hi, Iâ€™m AlacrisDevs (or Alex) ðŸ‘‹

I am a versatile creator from Estonia, specializing in **graphic design**, **event planning**, and **game development**.

## About Me

Graphic design has been my creative outlet since 2019. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of collaborating with over 30 clients to craft impactful **logos** and **brand identities** for both individuals and organizations. Iâ€™m passionate about bringing ideas to life through design, always striving to deliver memorable and effective visual experiences.

In addition to my work as a designer, Iâ€™m deeply involved in **game development**. In my free time, I explore programming and work on various game projects. One notable project is **Packet Tracers**, a multiplayer game I developed during my studies.

## Events and Community

I am also the main organizer of **TalTech GameCamp** and **Gamedev Guild**, events dedicated to connecting developers and enthusiasts. These platforms, hosted in collaboration with **Estonian game developers** and **TalTech Tallinn University of Technology**, have become key hubs for Estoniaâ€™s growing game development community. Through these events, I aim to foster knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration within the industry.

## My Portfolio

This website, which I built using **Vue**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, serves as a platform to showcase my portfolio of work. Itâ€™s a place where I can demonstrate my design and development skills, as well as provide insights into my creative process.
