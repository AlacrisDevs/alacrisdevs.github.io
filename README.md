## About

I'm Alex, an Estonian game developer who believes great things are built by strong communities. That's why I organize TalTech GameCamp and the GameDev Guild — two key gathering points for Estonia’s growing game development community.

My technical journey began at university where I developed and published Packet Tracers — a multiplayer game that taught me problem solving and programming. Today I apply that experience as a teaching assistant at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), guiding the next generation through Java and the LibGDX framework.

I'm motivated by the joy of creating — I love the process even more than the results. Whether it's debugging code with students or bringing developers together at events, I get my energy from the act of making.
