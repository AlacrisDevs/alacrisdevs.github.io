# portfolio-site
I am a 20-year-old graphic designer hailing from Estonia with a passion for crafting impactful logos and brands for individuals and organizations alike.
Graphic design has been my creative outlet since 2019, and over the years, I have had the privilege of serving numerous clients and helping them build their brand identities.
Beyond design, I delve into the world of game development and programming in my free time.

I crafted this website using HTML and CSS, not only as a practice to hone my skills but also to provide a dedicated platform for showcasing my portfolio of work.
