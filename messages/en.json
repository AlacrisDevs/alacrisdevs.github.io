	"about_body": "I'm Alex, a game developer from Estonia who believes the best games come from strong communities. That's why I organize TalTech GameCamp and Gamedev Guild - events that have become essential gathering spots for Estonia's growing game dev scene.\n\nMy technical journey started during university, where I developed and published Packet Tracers, a multiplayer game that taught me as much about problem-solving as it did about code. Today, I bring that experience to my role as a tutoring assistant at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), where I mentor the next generation of developers and help them navigate Java and the LibGDX framework.\n\nWhat drives me is the joy of creation - I love the process more than the result. Whether it's working through code challenges with students or bringing together developers for our events, the journey of building something is where I find my energy. I'm passionate about creating spaces where others can experience that same creative process."
